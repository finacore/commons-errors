# Commons Errors
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/finacore/commons-errors.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/finacore/commons-errors)

This module is part of __FINACORE__ software and has as objective to facilitate the error identification and handling throughout the time of software execution. 

As all other products and modules of __FINACORE__ project, this package has a strong code documentations that generates the fullfil tutorial disponible at [go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/finacore/commons-errors) reference page, that is enough for their usage.

This lib use [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) combined with [Horusec](https://horusec.io/) to understand the code quality and security, blocking the pull request in any vulnerability incidence.

As well as security, performance is a fundamental factor of all __FINACORE__ software, package or modules. This way this package use the __benchmark regression__ to ensure that no performance gaps ocours.

The result of benchmark regression is disponible at: [Performance Regeression](https://finacore.github.io/commons-errors/dev/bench/)
