# Commons Errors (CERR)
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/gsdenys/cerr.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gsdenys/cerr)

This module is a free software and their objective is to facilitate the error identification and handling throughout in the time of software execution. 

This package has a strong code documentations that generates the fullfil tutorial disponible at [go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gsdenys/cerr) reference page, that is enough for their usage.

This lib use [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) combined with [Horusec](https://horusec.io/) to understand the code quality and security, blocking the pull request in any vulnerability incidence.

As well as security, performance is a fundamental factor of all software, package or modules. This way, this package use the __benchmark regression__ to ensure that no performance gaps ocours.

The result of benchmark regression is disponible at: [Performance Regeression](https://gsdenys.github.io/cerr/dev/bench/)
